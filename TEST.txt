In the initial stages, we encountered difficulties with the first ten queries listed below. 
One notable issue was our handling of queries that contained multiple words. 
Initially, we only considered the first word, neglecting the rest. 
Another challenge pertained to our approach in assigning weights. 
At first, we used large weight values, leading to considerable discrepancies between them. 
However, by reducing the weights, we achieved more accurate search results. 
Additionally, we enhanced the efficiency of our search algorithm by considering stopwords only if they constituted more than half of the query.
